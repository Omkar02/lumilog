# lumilog
I'm glad you loved the suggestion "Lumilog"! Lumilog combines the concepts of code logging and visualisation into a single, evocative word. It can represent a software tool, platform, or system that offers illuminated and visual representations of code logs for enhanced understanding, analysis, and accountability.
